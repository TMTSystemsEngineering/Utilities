# Prerequisite:
#	1. Have a collection number for which collections and documents you would like mirrored on 
#	your personal computer. If there are collections you would like to exclude ensure
#	that they are appended to the 'exclude' variable with a comma
#	2. Have a directory in which you would like to save all the documents on your PC

# Expected Output:
#	As this script runs all collections and documents (except for excluded ones)
#	will be printed to the screen. Once traversed, it will the display all
#	information about documents located in the collection chosen and determine if they already exist
#	in the directory selected. Once the process is complete
#	you will be able to locate all files in the directory selected.
